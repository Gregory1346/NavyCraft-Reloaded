Solmex's public release version of the popular NavyCraft plugin. Build, drive and fight with custom ships, airplanes, tanks, and submarines! This project works on making NavyCraft more user-friendly and open for server-operators to apply to their own server. We hope to make the plugin more stable and more configurable for our users.

This version is the complete version of NavyCraft, including Shipyard, and Ranking.

This version features a better configuration setup. On first time run, the plugin will automatically generate new vehicle type files that are updated to the newest information. You can configure which EnabledWorlds the plugin will allow weapons to work in the navycraft.xml file (default is "null" to allow all worlds). Boat and airship type feature right-click style movement.
